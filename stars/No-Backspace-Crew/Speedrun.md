[Speedrun](https://github.com/No-Backspace-Crew/Speedrun/wiki) lets your users do exactly what they came to do straight from your documentation.  
It's a powerup for GitHub markdown that infuses your documentation with the ability to:

- [x] ❓ Prompt for inputs
- [x] ☕ Run JavaScript code
- [x] 🔑 Get AWS credentials
- [x] ⚙️ Reference configuration
- [x] 🚀 Federate into the AWS console
- [x] :godmode: Build an exact command line
- [x] 🐎 Invoke AWS Lambdas, AWS Step Functions and put events on EventBridge
