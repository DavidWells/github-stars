# GitHub Stars

Get all your starred repositories and save their README files in Markdown format.

## Features

- Automatically obtain all starred repository information
- Convert and save the README file to Markdown format
- Keep the basic information of the repository (project name, number of stars, description, etc.)
- Automatically run backups every week (via GitHub Actions)
- Contains error handling and retry mechanisms

## Usage

1. [Fork](https://github.com/davidwells/github-stars/fork) this repository
2. Create non-expiring Fine-grained personal access tokens, required permissions
   1. User permissions
      - Read access to starring
   2. Repository permissions
      - Read access to metadata
      - Read and Write access to code
3. Configure GitHub Actions keys `GH_TOKEN`
4. Run Actions

Initial seed is delayed for 30 seconds to avoid rate limiting.

```
export GH_TOKEN=your_token
export INITIAL_SEED=TRUE
node index.js
```

## Stars by date

I fancy myself a GitHub spelunker. Through my journeys I find a lot of cool packages. 

Below is an index for me to quickly find them.

Going from TS Types to JSON Schema to JS functions allows us to validate TS Types where the other packages all work with classes and reflection. | Jan 15, 2025 | 6          |
